# About O-Neko

O-Neko is a Kubernetes-native application that closes a gap between developers and other stakeholders by
deploying development versions of your software into Kubernetes to allow everybody to try and test them.

## Features

The most important features of O-Neko are:

* Deploy development versions (e.g. every branch) to Kubernetes with one click
* Configure projects with native Kubernetes .yaml files
* Automatically re-deploy running versions when the corresponding Docker image has changed (configurable per project and version)
* Automatically stop running versions after a specific time (configurable per project and version)
* Project meshes that allow you to wrap multiple projects into one pool and deploy specific versions of them together,
effectively providing a way to deploy dynamic test server setups with ease
* Select variables that allow fast changes to frequently used configuration settings (e.g. server URLs)

## Pre-requisites

Generally, nearly every project able to run in Kubernetes can be deployed with O-Neko (unless it relies on CRDs because our Kubernetes-Java-Client probably can't handle them correctly). To run a project in O-Neko:

* You need Docker containers of all project versions you want to deploy with O-Neko
* You need to provide the Kubernetes .yaml files in a simple template format to configure a project
* O-Neko works with kubernetes versions 1.9.0 - 1.17.0

## How does it work?

* O-Neko is running inside your Kubernetes cluster (at least this is our recommendation - you could run it outside as well as long as it is able to access your cluster).
* A project consists of a Docker image that resides in any Docker registry. O-Neko is polling all tags that are available for this image and lets you deploy them.
* The configuration is done with native Kubernetes .yaml and template variables. O-Neko provides some variables (e.g. the docker image tag), but you can also define your own. The configuration and the variables can be overridden by specific versions.
* When a version of a project is deployed, O-Neko creates a namespace in Kubernetes to deploy all resources to. If you stop a deployment, the corresponding namespace will be deleted.
* The status of all running deployments is monitored by O-Neko and can be seen on the web frontend

## O-Neko vocabulary

In O-Neko as well as in this documentation we often use terms that may be misunderstood for something else. We want
to clarify what specific words mean in the context of O-Neko.

### Project
A project is the entry point for deploying an application with O-Neko. Projects have a direct
association with a Docker image. Theoretically you can also have multiple projects referencing the same Docker image.
A project can have multiple versions. Projects can be configured using configuration templates.

### Project Version

A project version is associated with a tag of the project's docker image.
A project version inherits the project's configuration templates but can also override them or add entirely new configuration
templates. A project version can be deployed and automatically updated if the docker tag gets pushed again with different
contents (based on the checksum). This is especially useful for scenarios where the docker tags are not used to reference
e.g. a fixed commit but rather are a pointer to a current working copy (e.g. "the most recent version of the branch 
feature/my-new-feature").

### Configuration template

A configuration template is a native kubernetes .yaml file (e.g. a service definition).
Variable placeholders like `${MY_VARIABLE_NAME}` can be used to insert O-Neko specific variables into these templates.
The variables can be overridden in project versions to e.g. achieve slightly different configurations of versions without
having to modify the templates per version.

### Select variables

Select variables are template variables with pre-defined values. If (e.g.) your application
needs to connect to an external service E, you could have a variable consisting of the hostnames of the production, test
and development versions of E and you could quickly choose which instance of E to connect to from the O-Neko dashboard.

### Project mesh

A project mesh is a conglomerate of specific project versions. They can be used to create "static"
test setups that get automatically updated when the software changes. Example use case: Let's say you are developing a software that
consists of multiple programs (e.g. server + tools, microservices, etc.). You could e.g. set up a project mesh for every
major version of your software that is still actively maintained to get a "full" test setup.

### Docker registries

Docker registries in O-Neko are references to the registries your projects'
images are pulled from. To briefly learn how to set up a reference to a docker registry please see the 
"Show O-Neko your Docker Registry" section in the [getting started](./GETTING_STARTED.md).

### Namespaces

Namespaces are references to namespaces in your Kubernetes cluster. By default all project versions will be deployed into
their own namespaces with a generated name consisting of the project's name and the project version's name.
If you want a project version to be deployed into a specific namespace you can create a namespace reference via the
"Namespaces" page and select this namespace in the settings of the project version. 

### Activity Log

While not feature complete the activity log shows a basic history of some actions happening in your O-Neko installation (e.g. a project
has been edited or new docker tags/project versions have been found).

## Users and roles

O-Neko has user management with a very basic permission scheme consisting of three roles:

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| VIEWER | Can view projects (and versions) and deploy them or stop deployments. Can not modify them or change the configurations except of select variables that are displayed on the O-Neko dashboard. |
| DOER | Can also create and modify projects. |
| ADMIN | Can also manage users, docker registries and namespaces. |
